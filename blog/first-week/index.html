<div class="content"><h2 id="this-week-in-the-ableverse">This week in the ableVerse...</h2>
<h3 id="ableos-gets-a-config-option">... AbleOS gets a config option</h3>
<h3 id="ablescript-gets-a-0-2-release">... AbleScript gets a 0.2 release</h3>
<h3 id="ableblog-gets-its-first-issue">... AbleBlog gets its first issue</h3>
<h3 id="ableos">AbleOS</h3>
<p>Since the last few commits ableOS has been improved a lot, not only were basic config options added but a basic graphics libary and some general improvements as well.
This is one big step to <del>total world domination</del> making a well working operating system.</p>
<h3 id="ablescript">AbleScript</h3>
<p>Ok, so this is a little bit outdated but still very much worth to talk about.
There are 2 big features in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functio chaining with + and *</li>
<li>Carts holding keys and values</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ableblog">AbleBlog</h3>
<p>Well, this is self explanatory, you're reading the first issue of the ableBlog!
I am not sure how I want to continue this blog. I may switch to a 2 weekly or even monthly release cycle,
as there sadly is not that much you could talk about, happening just in one week.</p>
<h3 id="anyways">Anyways...</h3>
<p>... I hope you enjoyed the first issue of &quot;this week in the ableVerse&quot; see you later! :)</p>
