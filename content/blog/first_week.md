## This week in the ableVerse...
### ... AbleOS gets a config option
### ... AbleScript gets a 0.2 release
### ... AbleBlog gets its first issue

### AbleOS

Since the last few commits ableOS has been improved a lot, not only were basic config options added but a basic graphics libary and some general improvements as well.
This is one big step to ~~total world domination~~ making a well working operating system.

### AbleScript

Ok, so this is a little bit outdated but still very much worth to talk about.
There are 2 big features in this release:
- Functio chaining with + and *
- Carts holding keys and values

### AbleBlog

Well, this is self explanatory, you're reading the first issue of the ableBlog!
I am not sure how I want to continue this blog. I may switch to a 2 weekly or even monthly release cycle,
as there sadly is not that much you could talk about, happening just in one week.


### Anyways...
... I hope you enjoyed the first issue of "this week in the ableVerse" see you later! :)
